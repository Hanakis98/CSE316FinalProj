Running the App

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. 
cd into /server and run npm install and then npm start
cd into /client and run npm install and then npm start

Notes:

- The UI is ugly, however I prefer working on backend so i just wanted a competent UI.  
    Users can make an account, and design logos (these logos allow you to add texts, uplaod pictures etc) on there account. They can later download these logos as .pngs.
    They can also reset their password if they provide a valid email as there username. 
- Done in NodeJS, ReactJS
